    <h1>About me</h1>
    <h3>
      🇿🇦 Graphic designer and aspiring front-end developer, based in South
      Africa 💜
    </h3>
    <br /><br /><br />

    <br /><br /><br />
    <div class="about-paragraphs">
      <p class="about-me-info">
        As a 23-year-old professional graphic designer with a growing interest
        in front-end development, I bring a unique blend of creativity and
        technical skill to my work. Being born and raised in the diverse
        landscape of South Africa, I find inspiration in the rich tapestry of
        cultures that make up my home.
        <br />
        <br />
        While I cherish moments of solitude, my passion for connecting with
        others through my designs is unwavering. Cooking, scrapbooking, and
        losing myself in the rhythm of music are some of the simple joys that
        color my days.
      </p>
      <p class="about-me-info">
        An introvert by nature, I embrace my preference for quiet introspection,
        finding solace in the sanctuary of my thoughts. Yet, this does not deter
        my enthusiasm for lifelong learning; each day presents an opportunity to
        expand my horizons and deepen my understanding of the world.
        <br />
        <br />
        Despite my affinity for all things feminine-from makeup to fashion=I
        surprise many with my love for mobile shooting games, a hobby I happily
        share with my nephews. It's this contrast of interests that defines my
        multifaceted identity, reminding me that there's beauty in embracing the
        unexpected.
